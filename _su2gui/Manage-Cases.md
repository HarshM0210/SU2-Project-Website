## Loading a Case from the Terminal

When starting SU2GUI from the terminal, users can specify a case name. If the case already exists, SU2GUI will load it; if not, it will start a new case. For instructions on loading a case through the terminal, refer to the guide on [Terminal Initialization](./../Terminal-Initialization).
