This section explains how to use the mesh file in SU2GUI. Currently, SU2GUI only supports mesh files in .su2 format. For an overview of what a mesh file is, please refer to the [mesh file](../../docs_v7/Mesh-File/) page.

## Loading a Mesh File

SU2GUI offers the option to load a mesh file through both the GUI and the terminal. Loading the `.su2` mesh file is mandatory. Before doing so, it is necessary for the user to initialize a Case.

**Steps to load mesh file:**

 1. Start a new case. Follow these guides for detailed steps on [starting a new case](./../Manage-Cases/#starting-a-new-case).
 

 2. Click on the "Load Mesh File" option. ![](../../su2gui_files/User_guide/mesh/button-mesh-file.png)
 

 3. In the pop-up window, choose the desired mesh file. ![choose mesh file](../../su2gui_files/User_guide/mesh/choose-mesh-file.png)
 

 4.  The mesh file should now be loaded, and the properties in the GUI should be updated accordingly. ![loaded mesh file](../../su2gui_files/User_guide/mesh/loaded-mesh-file.png)



For instructions on loading a mesh file through the terminal, refer to the guide on [ Terminal Initialization](./../Terminal-Initialization).
